Golden Bark and Vine Bow

Blessed by an earth god
_Weapon (Long Bow), Very rare (requires attunement)_

An enchanted long bow made of vines and flowers, with a slender blade of grass for a string.

'**Stats and General Description** +1 Long Bow, Dmg 1d8 + Mods, Properties: Ammunition, Heavy, Range, Two-Handed Range: 150/600 Weight: 2

Milekki's Garden is a magical long bow made out of vines and flowers, with a very slender blade of grass serving as the string. It's believed to be an artifact made by the nature goddess Milekki herself, though others say that a group of druids shaped the weapon in her name for a particularly skilled and devoted ranger who had earned Milekki's favor.

_**Fruits of the Garden**_ Before a creature rolls for any attack, roll 1d4. Depending on the roll, the bow's damage and shape will change. 1. The bow twists and blackens as if burning and a few hollyhocks called a globe mallow bloom at the top of the bow. +1d6 fire damage 2. The bow produces dew which becomes a light coating of frost and shrivels as if in the deepest of winter. At the top of the weapon snow drop flowers bloom. +1d6 cold damage 3. The bow shines with radiant energy, and all the natural parts of the bow flourish as does the surrounding plant life if there is any, and the top of the bow produces goodberries, which can be eaten as a bonus action. Instead of dealing damage, you do 1d8+Mod+1 healing to any one ally that you can see, but must roll a ranged attack as if you were trying to hit them with an arrow. 4. The bow shakes violently and thunder peels in the distance. At full charge it releases a bolt of lightning, and leaves a straight line of electric blue flowers between the archer and the target. +1d6 lightning damage.

When you roll your attack with Milekki's Garden, roll as normal. If you roll a 1 on your normal attack roll, your attack fails, but you must roll your attack a second time. If the attack would have succeeded on the second roll, nothing happens and you can finish your roll. If your attack fails a second time, the bow loses that enchantment permanently. The other effects remain, but when you roll that number from then on, Milekki's Garden acts as a normal +1 Longbow. If all four enchantments are lost in this way, Milekki's Garden falls apart and returns to it's natural components.
