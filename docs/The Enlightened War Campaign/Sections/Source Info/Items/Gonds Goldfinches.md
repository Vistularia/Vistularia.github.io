# Item Name

Weopan of Aisha

Metallic Wrist Gauntlet with wings

Can turn into an all purpouse tool
Can store mana and spell slots

Can turn into two birds shown below


Partnership between Gond, 

-   **Wondrous Item, Uncommon +1), Rare (+2), Very Rare (+3) (Requires attunement)**

Despite looking like a simple screwdriver, the All-Purpose Tool may be the best weapon in an Artificer's arsenal. This screwdriver can **transform into any kind of artisan tool** that the Artificer needs. Additionally, the Artificer is Proficient in whatever form the All-Purpose Tool takes. While held, the All-Purpose Tool gives the Artificer a **bonus to Saving Throw DCs and Spell Attack Rolls**, based on the Tool's rarity.

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the All-Purpose Tool is its other property. The Artificer can **imbue [a Cantrip of their choice](https://gamerant.com/dungeons-dragons-best-5e-cantrips/)** into the All-Purpose Tool, which can come from any Class. When done so, the Cantrip becomes an Artificer Cantrip for the user for eight hours. The Artificer can choose another Cantrip to use at dawn
