	- Right before entering the Swamp, you got a feeling of being followed, but also met a Dwarf named Chimney who was a tradesman with bad organizational skills
	- Once you entered the swamps, you were soon trapped by Charley, an agent of the Order of the Red, who engaged your party in battle trying to capture XYZ
	- The party savagely beat down Charley and most definitely made a nemisis, but before the killshot, he summoned an Ancient Beast.

	- Venk & Chim indicated that the Guild Master Ae-Cha, Royal Knight Captain Samsara, and the Magician Guild leader Augustus were in town and knew more about the mysterious magical events that happened every two weeks
	- The group spied on these three officials and also learned that their was a double-agent within the local government who could have been Venk
	- With Venk the group found the warehouse of Giant Realty and followed a set of clues that led them to the hidden layer of the Crimson Crime Guild under the Mayor's office

	- Moving deeper into the sewers, the party saved a kidnapped Alejandro and followed the trails out of the sewers into local forest where they approached a secret encampment
	- At the encampment, the group followed a set of clues and by changing the red crystal orientations, they entered a parallel pocket dimension 
	- In this new area, the party found the kidnapped villagers who were being siphoned of their energy, and saw Venk who was arguing with an Aaracokra Mage (one of the lost races) named Zatu
	- Zatu told the party that the corrupted energy siphoned from the villagers was crucial in creating the Jewel of Ressurection which would bring back his leader
	- The party worked with Venk to defeat Zatu and his elementals, where Venk revealed that he was on their side and needed to destroy the Jewel to free his daughter from the corrupted energy
	- After almost sacrificing himself, Venk successfully cracked the Jewel of Trancendence which seemingly lost it's power and the siphoning of the villagers stopped with Zatu dissapearing
