# The Cartas Empire

The Cartas Empire is all you have known, a 'democracy' whose rule but moreso influence is felt throughout the land. In reality, this **parliamentary system** is often viewed as merely just a system placed to keep the races in harmonic accordance. 

Despite the many parties that situate themselves as bastion's of hope for the plights of the common, the educated sentiment is that these demogagues merely conform to one of the two largest parties, the **Modicus** who believe in that societal conformity to the strengths and weaknesses of each race dictate their duty and thus the success of the empire, and the **Cambiare**  who believe that the current societal hardship experienced comes from these archaic ideologies and that it is the individual who must be given the power to decide their soceital, business, and legislative influence. From the perspective of the common, these abstract ideals are not rooted in any sort of tangible improvement and as such are not worth considering until the weeks of the local ballots each year. 

Despite the beuracratic diconnect with the populace, one member of the **High Court** does garner public interest, and that is the seat of the **Royal Head**. The royal lineages of each race maintain a degree of structure ensuring that the seat on the high court is rotated among each race after terms of 50 years, or the death of the royal head. The royal lineages are said to stem from before the Unification. The current seat is held by **Elaine the III**, the Queen of the Human Domain and the previous seat was held by the high elf royal family. The royal seat remains one of the only governmental points of interest in the public, with their exploits and lives often reported in the local news and tabloids.
