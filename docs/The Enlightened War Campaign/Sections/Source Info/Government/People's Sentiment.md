### Peace & Poverty
However, despite the apparent structural peace within government and religious circuits, the people of the empire may tell another tale. The slow but growing decline of magic has slowed the technological progress of the empire and as such **resource inequality** remains at a higher level than ever. 

While trade within the empire continues, there exists an additional income and meritocratic inequality between the nobles/upper class and the rest of the society. This brewing discontent and plague of poverty has often brewed riots and protests in many rural and underserved city regions, where the government has dispatched their knights to 'maintain the peace'. 

As such **Crime & Smuggling guilds** have also seen an increase in prominence over the last hundred years. The discontent with the government has also not been aided by the fact that the Queen Elaine the 3rd has not been seen publicly in the last **10 years**.
