### Tribulations of Trade
Trade outside the continent and thus the input of new resources to the continent, has been stalled for the last 500 years. Exit from the continent in the North is blocked by the **Northern Wastelands**, cruelly cold and brutal lands of which explorers have never returned. 

Additionally, any escape beyond the continent by Sea has been halted by the **Ader Vortex**, a brutal current that destroys any ship that ventures more than several miles from the coast. As such visitors to the continent are unheard of and the Empire has concluded that civilized society outside of the continent must be devastated, savage, and dangerous to interact with.
