# Beskarville

A quaint town amongst the northernmost areas of settlement in Cartesia. Beskarville is rarely visited and is known primarily for it's prominence the first 200 years after the Great Unification as a source of dwarven Artifacts, namely Mithral said to be sourced from past wars. However soon after the Northern Mithral Rush calmed, the town was vacated by many of the travelers and the locals remained isolated. With the Northern Wastelands close, traders scarcely take the risk to venture to Beskarville, but one common tale is told. That howls echo each night, calling back and forth until the day breaks.

However in the recent month, a new vein of Dwarven artifacts have been discovered and along with it, a number of Cartesia's populace looking to claim the riches

### Politics & Government

The town remains of such a small size that no real representation is given on a national scale. Instead, the Northern Collective representative speaks for Beskarville in addition to the myriad of other towns that dot the northern boundaries. Within the town, the mayor and the sheriff are one and the same, an old dwarf named Lando.

### Defense & Threats

Lando remains the sheriff of the town as well and while he is seemingly strong, civil unrest is almost non existant. In fact the town reports some of the lowest crime statistics in the empire, but that is to be expected of the small and close-knit population. However one may ask how the town still exists with the recent sightings of monsters within the areas near the northern wastelands?

### Industry & Trade

The Northern Mithral Rush brought the large bulk of architecture and industry to the area, however soon after, the progress seems to have vacated. There are many larger buildings across the town that have been abandoned and many small businesses, including all the local inns had closed with the exception of one that usually catered to a trader lost in the path between Silinea and Kryoscene. 

However with the new discovery of the Dwarven Artifact deposits and the influx of, as the locals describe, 'scavengers', several encampments across the outskirts of town as well as the abandoned buildings have been occupied temporarily.
