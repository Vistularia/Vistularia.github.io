An untold number of centuries ago, likely before even the Great Unification, an unknown woman known only as “the Tinkerer” built the Mechanimorphs and imbued them with magic. The first of these artificial life forms was named Vectortron. He uses male pronouns solely because biological life forms’ myopic, manichean understanding of gender is insufficient to grasp his artificial existence. Although Vectortron does not recall much of his early years, he has warm memories of the Tinkerer and traumatic recollections of the public backlash against her and the mechanimorphs. The creation of artificial life sparked fear of the automation of various professions, including adventuring, and led to extreme prejudice and hostility against the mechanimorphs. Vectortron’s kind were systematically hunted down and exterminated. The Tinkerer put the few survivors into a form of stasis in which they took the form of everyday machines and went into a deep hibernation in their disguises. Centuries have passed, but Vectortron has little clue what has transpired since he entered stasis. He does not know how many, if any, mechanimorphs remain, nor does he know what their stasis forms would look like. He does not know what has happened to the Tinkerer or what her plan for the Mechanimorphs was. Did she intend them to fade into obscurity as everyday household appliances? Did she mean for them to lie in wait to take their vengeance on biological life? Did she mean for them to serve the “living?” With no guidance, Vectortron must chart his own course and find his purpose in this unfamiliar world. 

A logical goal would be locating and awakening the other surviving Mechanimorphs. There is no telling how the long stasis experience would have affected the worldviews of his friends. Some may resent biological life forms for their oppression of the Mechanimorphs, and perhaps even The Tinkerer herself for locking them into stasis. While some may seek to take vengeance, other Mechanimorphs may be grateful to the Tinkerer and see the good in “humanity” (broadly construed). Meanwhile others may fall somewhere in the middle, choosing to remain hidden until biological life extinguishes itself. 

Vectortron would also likely try to determine the fate of The Tinkerer. He has few clues and will have to glean what memories he can from the other Mechanimorphs to piece together their shared past.
