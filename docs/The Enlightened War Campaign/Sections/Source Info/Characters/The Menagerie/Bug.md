Early Life & Origins

  

-   Along with consciousness, Bug lost her connections to the 'mother' and as such she does feel the loneliness of being your own individual, now being a high elf.
    

  

-   Bug thought about rejoining the hive mind, however her own feelings of self preservation for her identity gave you a sense of mortality and fear.
    

  

-   Bug spent a couple months navigating out of the Jungle of Jewels and this is where she recalled most of her Druidic Knowledge, Arcane Abilities, and Basic Knowledge from their past life.
    

  

-   Bug is aware that the knowledge bursts she receives are from her 'past' life, however her attempts to access the rest have yielded no results. She doesn't even know her past life's name.
    

  

-   Bug is both mesmerized and terrified of emotions and oftentimes has a slight dissonance between what she perceives and then what her body feels emotionally and physically.
    

  

-   Bug will receive slivers of memories from her body and they have usually been more survival based.
    

  

-   After Escaping the Jungle of Jewels, Bug spent a couple months in Baruba, navigating her body and feelings more, learning the basics of society, and earning money working odd jobs. She barely spoke and had no friends, and in her free time, she practiced her arcane abilities.
    

  
  

Recent Comings

  

-   Bug was working in an inn when she experienced the most recent quick memory of her host being an adventurer. This memory was powerful, not only giving her feelings of happiness, but also vague feelings of purpose and camaraderie? It was after this memory that Bug decided to become an adventurer and learn more about her past and consciousness.
    

  

-   Bug left for Portglassia and before entering town was immediately hit with a memory, but this one was different than usual. It not only came as a word, but also partly as a command. What came into Bug's mind was, "Seek the Ferret's secrets"
    

  
  
  

Notable Names

  

Archie Allison

  

-   This was the kind elderly gnome innkeeper who offered Bug their first job in Baruba and gave her a room to stay in the inn. Bug learned much of society through her brief conversations with him.Â 
    

  

Springmiss Allison

  

-   The sister of Archie who resides in the west district of Portglassia. Archie told Bug that she worked in the local tinkerer's guild and would also offer any help if Bug needed.
    

  

The Third Crow

  

-   This title has come to your mind a couple times, however any attempts to further learn why have been fruitless. You however do know that you feel both slight fear and reverence when you think of this title.
    

  
  
  

World Knowledge

  

Given your recent awakening, Bug only knows the general world knowledge equivalent to what has been detailed in the world introduction documents.

  

Alignment and Journey

-   Bug herself often views her decision making as apathetic and rationalistic, logical, however her body often disagrees with her judgment and she has noticed that she tends to favor decisions of the slightly good disposition. Bug finds herself navigating many questions and as such believes that being an adventurer will help her truly understand her position in this world. Some of these questions include...
    

-   Is death truly a bad thing, and is consciousness worth it?
    
-   Is consciousness a boon or a curse?
    
-   Should I pursue a path of logic or morality?
    
-   Am I truly my own person?
    
-   Do I have a soul, or rather do I want to have a soul?
    
-   How do I quell this loneliness within me, and should I pursue this abstract emotion of happiness?
