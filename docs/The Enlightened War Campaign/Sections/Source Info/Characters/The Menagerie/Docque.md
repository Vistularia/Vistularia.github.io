Early Life & Origins

  

-   Doque was found on the shores of the Southern Kingdom by the Halifa Southern Orc Tribe. He was quickly adopted by the tribe as they saw him as perhaps an ugly orc who was abandoned by his mother.
    

  

-   Doque grew up in the nomadic orc tribes. Orcs in this time are much different than their pre-unification counterparts. They may be nomadic, however their structures are engineering feats and highly technical. Orcs on the continent worship their mother god Lulthi, who is the only one of the pantheon to remain communicating with them. They are a society of brash, but loyal individuals where one's pride comes from not only their strength, but also their importance to society. As such, orcs make up a large portion of the empire's army, providing not only unparalleled strength, but the ability to endure hardships such as those up north and on the sea. 
    

  

-   The Halifa Southern Orc Tribe are also known largely for raising sea-faring orcs, where the tribe operates a lot of the sea trade around the continent and send many individuals to the royal navy. 
    

  

-   Doque felt different growing up with his compatriots and was often teased for his lack of strength and intensity. His adoptive mother, one of tribe elders, however saw potential for his intelligence and wisdom and gave Doque permission to study up north in Muristar for a couple years to not only learn general knowledge for the tribe, but also clockwork sorcery
    

  

-   Doque completed his initial training, however he soon felt homesick and wanted to serve with his brethren so he joined the royal navy with an orc battalion made up of his tribe members.
    

  
  

Recent Comings

  

-   Doque was on a shipment to the northern base at Kryoscene when the worst occurred. Around the continent, the carefully mapped out boundary of the Adder Vortex suddenly shifted inward by 2 miles and many large ships were suddenly damaged and dragged into the deep. This day was known as the **Tragedy of the Tides**
    

  

-   Doque saw his entire crew perish that day and he too was dragged into the depths. However it was there that he regrettably met his patron. His Patron appeared to Doque for only a few brief moments, but spoke to him as a parent speaks to a child. Doque remembers these words, 
    

-   "Ah I see you are still alive, good, you will be of use"
    

  

-   "Living as an orc, ha! You are no orc you fool."
    
-   "You will live on and accept my influence"
    
-   "Your family? Ah yes, I unfortunately cannot save these orcs in the water with you, my influence only reaches in so far"
    

  

-   Doque awoke on the shore of the eastern coast and made his way to Solteros where he learned he was the only survivor of his ship.
    

  

-   In deep anguish, Doque missed his compatriots and was left with a deep resentment for his survival and his encounter with his 'patron'. After drowning his sorrows in taverns for a couple months, taking 'time' for himself and traveling, Doque soon found himself in Portglassia.
    

  

-   Here he learned of the path of the adventurer and his joy was kindled yet again. Perhaps he could find brethren to work with again? And perhaps he could earn glory so that he could return to his tribe in pride to make up for the shame.
    

  
  

Notable Names

  

Mother Farata

  

-   The adoptive mother of Doque and one of the four tribal elders of the Halifa Southern Orc Tribe. A kind but stoic maternal figure to Doque who never belittles him for his differences, instead she encouraged him to try harder and make his own way. She allowed his study in Muristar and she also oversees naval appointments from the tribe. Doque feels responsibility and survivor's guilt from the Tragedy of the Tides and wants to return to Mother Farata with news to be proud of.
    

  
  

M.I.T & Chiswald Pumus

  

-   Doque studied his Clockwork Sorcery at the Muristar Institute of Technomancy and his mentor/close friend was a noble dwarf named Chiswald Pumus.
    

  
  

The 16th Fleet, Fleet of the White Wails

  

-   This was the Fleet number and unofficial name of the fleet that Doque served on with his orc brethren during his time in the Royal Navy.
