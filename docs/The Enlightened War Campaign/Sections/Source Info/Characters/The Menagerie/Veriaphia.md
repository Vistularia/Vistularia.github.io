Location: Loxodons live in the central section of the Cartas Empire among the swamps and mountains of the Ethereal Pinches. Loxodons almost never leave this area and very few have been seen outside the Ethereal Pinches since the Great Unification.

Religion: Loxodons primarily follow Torm, the god of duty, loyalty, and righteousness. Many Loxodons, particularly those with a focus on healing arts and natural remedies, also follow Eldath, the goddess of comfort, healing, and serenity.

Occupation: The Ethereal Pinches are a key trade node for the Cartas Empire. The Loxodonian people’s primary source of income is managing the passage of goods across their lands. While a select group of merchants are permitted to cross Loxodonian lands, Loxodons generally prefer to manage internal trade themselves, which they state allows them to maintain the peace and tranquility of their lands. As a result, most of their trading activity occurs at outposts along the edges of their lands. Loxodons also have a natural talent for stonework and engraved or carved stone goods are their primary export.

Mystery: King Thraz’s regime is rumored to have connections to a criminal syndicate. These stories have been shared among only a few individuals, in part due to the Loxodons’ isolation.


Loxodon King: Thraz Threrdom

Loxodon Queen: Vetri Difya Threrdom

Important Noble Loxodon Houses: Threrdom, Difya, Galtine, Hadros, and Vokos

For the Loxodon royal family, patrilineal inheritance serves as a baseline to determine the order of succession. However, Loxodonian law does allow for adjustments to the order of succession based on personal achievements and assessed capacity to rule. For example, when former King Thriton determined his order of succession, he placed his daughter, Tesne (Veriaphia’s mother) before his brother, Talros. While this had little effect on the inheritance of the crown since Thriton had two sons, Thraz and Tiroj, the decision served as a reminder to the Loxodonian people and the royal family that the line of succession could be adjusted. The decision also created a temporary rift among the royal Loxodons as Talros resented his demotion and House Difya felt slighted by the decision since the eldest Difya daughter, Yusnar, had married Talros. King Thriton managed to repair this rift, at least in part, by marrying his eldest son and heir, Thraz, to Vetri Difya, making Talros a frustrated outlier rather than an heir with a claim backed by a powerful noble house.

**Key Relationships**

Thredoz Threrdom (Forge Domain Cleric): Veriaphia is close to her eldest cousin, Thredoz, the heir to the Loxodonian throne. As children, Veriaphia and Thredoz often pranked their other cousins or other family members and played boisterous games, but as Thredoz began to take on a more important role in the community, he had less time for Veriaphia. Veriaphia respects her cousin and values their relationship, but she also resents the ease with which he is accepted by their fellow Loxodons and fits into the royal family. Thredoz always maintains a serene, focused demeanor and excels at stonework. As he’s begun to participate in official duties since coming of age, he’s become well known among the general public for his calming commentary in public messaging.

Soofya Threrdom (Circle of the Land Druid): Soofya is Veriaphia’s maternal great aunt. While she never married or aspired to greater prominence within the royal family, she was a valued member of the Loxodon community for her knowledge of the healing arts and religious leadership for those who follow Eldath, the goddess of serenity, comfort, and healing. Soofya spent much of her time in the Loxodon’s swamplands, collecting herbs and testing out new remedies. It was there that she encountered Veriaphia, who turned to the swamps to escape the more accepted playtime practices of young Loxodons, such as gardening, practicing calligraphy, or meditating. While the two could not have been more different, Soofya and Veriaphia grew close over time. Soofya even began to teach Veriaphia some of her healing magic, much to the delight of Veriaphia’s mother, who was excited to see Veriaphia embracing traditional Loxodonian practices. However, unlike Tesne, Soofya could see that Veriaphia’s talents lay outside of the healing realm. On her deathbed, Soofya passed Veriaphia a ceremonial sword and shield engraved with Torm’s sigil that had belonged to Soofya’s grandfather. She reminded Veriaphia that the most peaceful path was not always the right path and encouraged her to pursue adventuring beyond the Loxodonian lands.

Tesne Threrdom Hadros (Life Domain Cleric): Early on in her life, Tesne’s father, King Thriton, named her third in line for the throne, surpassing Talros, her uncle, as Thriton determined Tesne was more suited for the crown. This was largely due to the fact that many believed Talros had taken his pursuit of healing magic too close to necromancy, which most Loxodons view as disruptive to the natural order. In contrast, Tesne was well known for her life magic, and as a result, was placed in the succession order before her uncle. When Thraz became king, he removed both Tesne and Talros from the line of succession in an effort to move past the controversy and focus on the future – his children, nieces, and nephews. Tesne wishes her success, and more, for Veriaphia, and she believes the way to do so is through the pursuit of traditional Loxodonian arts: healing, law, and stonework, among others. While Veriaphia shares much of her mother’s ambition, their differences on how to achieve such goals have led to many disagreements.

**Personality & Background**

Veriaphia is eager to please but very insecure, as she’s largely felt as though she’s been unable to live up to her family’s expectations, particularly her mother’s. She resents what she views as her arbitrary placement in the family lineage and is jealous of her older male cousins who, in her eyes, did very little to achieve a more prominent position in the family and greater power. However, Veriaphia also feels deeply connected to her Loxodon community and her birthplace. Despite her frustrations with her family members, she values her connection to them and seeks to prove her place among them rather than forgo them altogether. When she is with the royal family or participating in her official duties, Veriaphia tries very hard to maintain the calm, serene attitude for which Loxodon’s are known, with mixed success. If she’s not trying to adjust her personality, Veriaphia is naturally extroverted and talkative, but she has a short fuse. She’s quick to anger when her differences or unimportance are pointed out, some particular paint points include comments on her clumsiness, discussions of her tendency to run places unnecessarily, or use of the nickname “Phi Phi”. When outside Loxodon land’s, Veriaphia will be set off by negative comments about Loxodons or misunderstanding of Loxodonian practices. Personality inspiration for her is Gretchen Wieners and a sprinkle of Veruca Salt.
