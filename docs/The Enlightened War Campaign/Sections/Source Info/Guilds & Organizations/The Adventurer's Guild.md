# Advent of Adventurers
While the legendary heroes found their beginnings as adventurers, the role of adventurers had fallen out of practice by 100 A.U. By this time, most of the remnants of  terrible monsters had been wiped out and all that remained were the pesky creatures that were hardly left a stable income for the adventurers. 

However all that has changed in the **last 75 years**. Monsters began to emerge again in the forgotten regions of the continent and they soon found their way into threatening rural populations. Combined with the public distruct, decline of magic, and the increase in crime, the Cartas Empire established the **Official Adventurers Guild**, and entity outside of government control to manage and contract new parties of adventurers. While the **Cartas Royal Knights** and the **Mighty 9** were able to take on larger threats, the adventuring guild began to nurture the growth of new adventurers, albeit hard to convince many to take on the arduous and dangerous lifestyle. 
```
```
Currently, there has been a stall in adventurer growth and the Cartas Empire has just announced the implementation of **Officially Recognized Adventuring Parties**, where adventurering parties who prove themselves will be given sponsorship by the government in addition to access to both known and rumored government resources.
