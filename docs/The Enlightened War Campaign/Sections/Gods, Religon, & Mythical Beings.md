# Worship in Cartesia

God powers are diminished
Cannot enter into the realm

### Gods & Mortals
The gods working together was an important takeaway from the legend of the Unification, where the Cartas Empire has allowed **the freedom of religion to all the people**, so long as the religious organizations do not threaten the safety of the empire. 

However, where many believe that the power of these deities allowed them to walk the planes with us before the Unification, the interaction of these gods in our current time is very rare and often reserved to a couple words or guidance given through the veil from the Holy Realm or Faerun. As such, only the powerful priests and priestesses of each religion can maintain a semblance of communication to their gods, but the line of magic that supplies the power of clerics, paladins and warlocks do remain, albeit to a fewer amount of individuals as the years progress. 

In fact, magic in general has begun diminishing over the last 300 years where popularity has grown in the development of **Wizarding and Healing Guilds** as their services become rarer. Religious membership has perhaps grown in the opposite direction, with a majority of the populace with varied levels of commitment belonging to a religious organization. The heads of these organizations/temples often convey the guidance of the gods to their followers and also hold a degree of power within the government where a seat on the high court is also given to the **Chief Religous Officiate** chosen by the **Great Religious Council**.
