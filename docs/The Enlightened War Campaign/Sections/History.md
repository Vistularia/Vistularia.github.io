### The Forgotten

Perhaps the lack of interest in government tidings can be attributed to the general era of peace that has encompassed the continent for the last 500. Wars between races and domains are unheard of and large scale bloodshed are a thing of legends, but rather that is all the they could be. 

You see, the **current year is 502 A.U.** (Anno Unifico) and 502 years of history is all that really exists. The legends and records of the empire go back the last 500 years, back to the event of the Great Unification, however history past that point has been lost, forgotten. Records in the libraries of the great cities detail nothing past this point and perhaps the great tomb of the capital may contain more, but society has accepted that this lost time frame is beyond our capabilities to ascertain, or more so, a time frame that doesn't matter, that isn't worth remembering.

Even those who lived through this period of forgotten history have seemed to forget all details of the society and events of the time, only holding on to the seldom memories of their fellow bonds and core knowledge. While this lost time was perhaps a great concern before 100 U.P., the priority of collecting this knowledge has fallen to perhaps a few historical researchers at the great universities or noble houses and the Cartas Empire officially ruled many years ago that this time was forgotten for good reason, perhaps through magic or collective trauma, and would serve no purpose in the modern society.

### Legend of the Great Unification

However, the general legend that does surround the **Great Unification** has pervaded through the ages. Before the Unification, the races & religions warred with each other and the people suffered both through mortal and wicked bloodshed. Monsters were commonplace and terrorized the people where war often seemed like a preferable option. The respite to this darkness came from the **Legendary 6 heroes**, adventurers  from different races, domains, and walks of life. These heroes banded together and worked with the gods to destroy the sources of darkness, sacrificing their lifes in the process. 

Their tales of heroism, their saga, and even their names have found themselves as folk stories across the continent, perhaps lost in true details after centuries of storytelling, but not lacking in their insipiration. It was their sacrifice and defeat of the darkness that marked the Great Unification, where races now lived together in peace and the Cartas Empire became the hope of Cartulia. However this only accounts for the **6 key races** that make up the continent. The legends and ruins often point to many other races existing, however these races were thought to have perished before the Great Unification and have not been seen in the Cartas Empire.
