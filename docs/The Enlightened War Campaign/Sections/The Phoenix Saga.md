### Prophecy & Poetry

As the divine connection has weakened in the empire, so has the adherence to divine prophecy. The legends of the Unification describe the great prophecies of the past and how they chose and guided the Legendary 6 heroes, however the only prophecy since the inception of the Cartas Empire was told after a century of silence in **100 A.U**. The only words muttered by the oracle were, "The Song of the Firebird tells the past and future indiscriminately..."

The experts of the empire thought this to refer to the great poem & song written by **Daxys**, the bard-paladin and leader of the legendary 6 Heroes. The famed poem titled **"Our Fateful Phoenix,"** was written to his love before the final battle and details the exploits and heroic nature of his party. While the poem in it's entirety is hard hear, many subsections or rewrites find themselves in taverns performed by bards as a classic love sonnet. Since no danger came after the divine prophecy was told, the empi re gradually took this to mean that the Great Unification was the last mythical quest necessary and the future holds only mortal struggles.
