# The World of Vistularia

Welcome to the world of Vistularia. The continent you find yourselves in, Cartesia is one of mystique, wonder, and soul. Here reigns The Cartas Empire.


## The Cartas Empire

### Government
The Cartas Empire is all you have known, a 'democracy' whose rule but moreso influence is felt throughout the land. In reality, this **parliamentary system** is often viewed as merely just a system placed to keep the races in harmonic accordance. 

Despite the many parties that situate themselves as bastion's of hope for the plights of the common, the educated sentiment is that these demogagues merely conform to one of the two largest parties, the **Modicus** who believe in that societal conformity to the strengths and weaknesses of each race dictate their duty and thus the success of the empire, and the **Cambiare**  who believe that the current societal hardship experienced comes from these archaic ideologies and that it is the individual who must be given the power to decide their soceital, business, and legislative influence. From the perspective of the common, these abstract ideals are not rooted in any sort of tangible improvement and as such are not worth considering until the weeks of the local ballots each year. 

Despite the beuracratic diconnect with the populace, one member of the **High Court** does garner public interest, and that is the seat of the **Royal Head**. The royal lineages of each race maintain a degree of structure ensuring that the seat on the high court is rotated among each race after terms of 50 years, or the death of the royal head. The royal lineages are said to stem from before the Unification. The current seat is held by **Elaine the III**, the Queen of the Human Domain and the previous seat was held by the high elf royal family. The royal seat remains one of the only governmental points of interest in the public, with their exploits and lives often reported in the local news and tabloids.

### The Forgotten

Perhaps the lack of interest in government tidings can be attributed to the general era of peace that has encompassed the continent for the last 500. Wars between races and domains are unheard of and large scale bloodshed are a thing of legends, but rather that is all the they could be. 

You see, the **current year is 502 A.U.** (Anno Unifico) and 502 years of history is all that really exists. The legends and records of the empire go back the last 500 years, back to the event of the Great Unification, however history past that point has been lost, forgotten. Records in the libraries of the great cities detail nothing past this point and perhaps the great tomb of the capital may contain more, but society has accepted that this lost time frame is beyond our capabilities to ascertain, or more so, a time frame that doesn't matter, that isn't worth remembering.

Even those who lived through this period of forgotten history have seemed to forget all details of the society and events of the time, only holding on to the seldom memories of their fellow bonds and core knowledge. While this lost time was perhaps a great concern before 100 U.P., the priority of collecting this knowledge has fallen to perhaps a few historical researchers at the great universities or noble houses and the Cartas Empire officially ruled many years ago that this time was forgotten for good reason, perhaps through magic or collective trauma, and would serve no purpose in the modern society.

### Legend of the Great Unification

However, the general legend that does surround the **Great Unification** has pervaded through the ages. Before the Unification, the races & religions warred with each other and the people suffered both through mortal and wicked bloodshed. Monsters were commonplace and terrorized the people where war often seemed like a preferable option. The respite to this darkness came from the **Legendary 6 heroes**, adventurers  from different races, domains, and walks of life. These heroes banded together and worked with the gods to destroy the sources of darkness, sacrificing their lifes in the process. 

Their tales of heroism, their saga, and even their names have found themselves as folk stories across the continent, perhaps lost in true details after centuries of storytelling, but not lacking in their insipiration. It was their sacrifice and defeat of the darkness that marked the Great Unification, where races now lived together in peace and the Cartas Empire became the hope of Cartulia. However this only accounts for the **6 key races** that make up the continent. The legends and ruins often point to many other races existing, however these races were thought to have perished before the Great Unification and have not been seen in the Cartas Empire.

### Gods & Mortals
The gods working together was an important takeaway from the legend of the Unification, where the Cartas Empire has allowed **the freedom of religion to all the people**, so long as the religious organizations do not threaten the safety of the empire. 

However, where many believe that the power of these deities allowed them to walk the planes with us before the Unification, the interaction of these gods in our current time is very rare and often reserved to a couple words or guidance given through the veil from the Holy Realm or Faerun. As such, only the powerful priests and priestesses of each religion can maintain a semblance of communication to their gods, but the line of magic that supplies the power of clerics, paladins and warlocks do remain, albeit to a fewer amount of individuals as the years progress. 

In fact, magic in general has begun diminishing over the last 300 years where popularity has grown in the development of **Wizarding and Healing Guilds** as their services become rarer. Religious membership has perhaps grown in the opposite direction, with a majority of the populace with varied levels of commitment belonging to a religious organization. The heads of these organizations/temples often convey the guidance of the gods to their followers and also hold a degree of power within the government where a seat on the high court is also given to the **Chief Religous Officiate** chosen by the **Great Religious Council**.

### Prophecy & Poetry

As the divine connection has weakened in the empire, so has the adherence to divine prophecy. The legends of the Unification describe the great prophecies of the past and how they chose and guided the Legendary 6 heroes, however the only prophecy since the inception of the Cartas Empire was told after a century of silence in **100 A.U**. The only words muttered by the oracle were, "The Song of the Firebird tells the past and future indiscriminately..."

The experts of the empire thought this to refer to the great poem & song written by **Daxys**, the bard-paladin and leader of the legendary 6 Heroes. The famed poem titled **"The Phoenix Saga"** was written to his love before the final battle and details the exploits and heroic nature of his party. While the poem in it's entirety is hard to hear, many subsections or rewrites find themselves in taverns performed by bards as a classic love sonnet. Since no danger came after the divine prophecy was told, the empire gradually took this to mean that the Great Unification was the last mythical quest necessary and the future holds only mortal struggles.

### Peace & Poverty
However, despite the apparent structural peace within government and religious circuits, the people of the empire may tell another tale. The slow but growing decline of magic has slowed the technological progress of the empire and as such **resource inequality** remains at a higher level than ever. 

While trade within the empire continues, there exists an additional income and meritocratic inequality between the nobles/upper class and the rest of the society. This brewing discontent and plague of poverty has often brewed riots and protests in many rural and underserved city regions, where the government has dispatched their knights to 'maintain the peace'. 

As such **Crime & Smuggling guilds** have also seen an increase in prominence over the last hundred years. The discontent with the government has also not been aided by the fact that the Queen Elaine the 3rd has not been seen publicly in the last **5 years**. 

### Tribulations of Trade
Trade outside the continent and thus the input of new resources to the continent, has been stalled for the last 500 years. Exit from the continent in the North is blocked by the **Northern Wastelands**, cruelly cold and brutal lands of which explorers have never returned. 

Additionally, any escape beyond the continent by Sea has been halted by the **Ader Vortex**, a brutal current that destroys any ship that ventures more than several miles from the coast. As such visitors to the continent are unheard of and the Empire has concluded that civilized society outside of the continent must be devastated, savage, and dangerous to interact with. 

### Advent of Adventurers
While the legendary heroes found their beginnings as adventurers, the role of adventurers had fallen out of practice by 100 A.U. By this time, most of the remnants of  terrible monsters had been wiped out and all that remained were the pesky creatures that were hardly left a stable income for the adventurers. 

However all that has changed in the **last 75 years**. Monsters began to emerge again in the forgotten regions of the continent and they soon found their way into threatening rural populations. Combined with the public distruct, decline of magic, and the increase in crime, the Cartas Empire established the **Official Adventurers Guild**, and entity outside of government control to manage and contract new parties of adventurers. While the **Royal Cartesian Knights** and the **Tenfold Heralds** were able to take on larger threats, the adventuring guild began to nurture the growth of new adventurers, albeit hard to convince many to take on the arduous and dangerous lifestyle.

Currently, there has been a stall in adventurer growth and the Cartas Empire has just announced the implementation of **Officially Recognized Adventuring Parties**, where adventurering parties who prove themselves will be given sponsorship by the government in addition to access to both known and rumored government resources.
